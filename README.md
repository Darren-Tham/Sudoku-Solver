# Sudoku-Solver
Solve a Sudoku board and visualize backtracking algorithm!

## Introduction
This program will solve an incompleted Sudoku board and display the fully solved board or alert the user that the board is unsolvable!

In addition, the user can visualize the backtracking algorithm used to solve the Sudoku board!

This project helped me learn TypeScript with React!

## How To Use
To fill out the Sudoku board, you can click on the input boxes and type in a number.

Also, it will highlight the row, column, and section where the input box is located, and it will highlight other input boxes purple with the same number.
* Tip: If you typed the wrong number, you do not need to backspace. You can simply retype the number!

To navigate around the board, you can click on another input box.

Additionally, you can use the arrow keys, WASD, or (for coders) CTRL + PBNF.
